# Presentation 2018-04: Tour of Heroes Knockout

This project is a companion to a presentation from April 2018, and might not make sense without that context.

## ⚠️ Notice about updates

Note that this repository is provided "as-is" and will most likely not receive any (security) updates.

## More info

This application is intentionally simple, lacking a proper build pipeline and so forth. To do some meaningful work with it I suggest `npm install --global livereload serve`, and then running `livereload .` and `serve .` in the `/src` folder respectively.
